## Overview

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://qr-code-component-by-vrlclk.netlify.app/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Native CSS global variables
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Use a CSS reset template to avoid browser's initial values
- How to use Google Fonts and link the fonts to your stylesheet
- Placing elements to the center using Grid instead of Flexbox
- Giving every element a specific meaning using 'BAM naming conventions'
- Use global CSS variables to avoid setting the same values mutiple times
- Only one change of the values of the CSS variables required than searching every single value and change them one by one.
- How to commit your work to GitHub with Visual Studio Code (no CLI, no GitHub Desktop)
- How to deploy your work/creation with Netlify

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau's CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - Kevin Powell recommends this CSS reset because it has less code than Eric Meyer's CSS Reset and it's new.
- [Naming BAM naming conventions](https://getbem.com/naming/) - Use this to specify every element you want to edit.
- [Practical example of BAM naming conventions](https://youtu.be/B2WL6KkqhLQ?t=504) - Kevin Powell shows some examples of using BAM naming conventions - Timestamp: 8:24
- [Center an element using Grid](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-grid-center-element/) - I use number four with ``place-items: center;``, you save a line of code instead of the famous flex way with ``align-items: center; justify-content: center;``
- [Upload your project to GitHub and release them with Netlify](https://youtu.be/B2WL6KkqhLQ?t=3712) - Kevin Powell shows you step-by-step on how to do it.
